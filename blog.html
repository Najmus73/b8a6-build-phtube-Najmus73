  <div> <h1 class="font-bold text-lg">1.Discuss the scope of var, let, and const - </h1>
    <h3>var declarations are globally scoped or function scoped while let and const are block scoped.
        var variables can be updated and re-declared within its scope; let variables can be updated but not re-declared; const variables can neither be updated nor re-declared.
        They are all hoisted to the top of their scope. But while var variables are initialized with undefined, let and const variables are not initialized.
        While var and let can be declared without being initialized, const must be initialized during declaration.</h3>
    <h1 class="font-bold text-lg">2.Tell us the use cases of null and undefined - </h1>
    <h3><h1 class="font-bold text-lg">Null -</h1>
        
        The primitive value null is used as an intentional "empty value" for a variable. In other languages, a similar construct might be used only for (missing) objects or pointer types. In JavaScript null generally represents an empty value for any type.</h3>
       <h1 class="font-bold text-lg">Undefined -</h1> 
A variable that has not been assigned a value is of type undefined.1

That means while null represents an empty value (but still a value), undefined represents the total absence of a value.

undefined appears in different contexts.

If a variable is declared without a value (initialization), it is undefined.
If you try to access a value for a non-existing key in an object, you get undefined.
If a function does not return a value, the result is undefined.
If an argument is not passed to a function, it is undefined, unless that argument has a default value.
    <h1 class="font-bold text-lg">3.What do you mean by REST API? -</h1>
    <h3>What is an API?
        Since we're talking about REST APIs, our definition of an API will not go beyond the scope of the web.
        
        API stands for Application Programming Interface. An API establishes a connection between programs so they can transfer data.
        
        A program that has an API implies that some parts of its data is exposed for the client to use. The client could be the frontend of the same program or an external program.
        
        In order to get this data, a structured request has to be sent to the API. If the request meets the desired requirements, a response which contains the data gets sent back to where the request was made. This response usually comes in the form of JSON or XML data.
        
        In some cases, you'll need some sort of authorization to gain access to external API data.
        
        Every API has documentation that tells you what data is available and how to structure your request in order to get a valid response.</h3>
